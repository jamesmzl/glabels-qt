## What is gLabels-qt?

gLabels-qt is the development version of the next major version of gLabels (4.0).


## What's new in gLabels 4?

- Based on the Qt5 framework.
- Updated UI based on typical workflows.
- Intended to be a cross-platform application.
    * So far, it has been built and tested under Linux, Windows 7, and Windows 10. (Windows testing is still very intermittent.)


## Status

gLabels-qt has been under off-and-on development for several years.
It is still missing several features to bring it in parity with glabels-3.4.  These include

- Optional Evolution and VCard backends.
- An online manual
